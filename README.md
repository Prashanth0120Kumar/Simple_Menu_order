The Veggie Pizza app is a seamless pizza ordering solution powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This intuitive app encompasses the following key functionalities:

1. **Order Form with Validations (HTML & CSS):** The app's foundation is an HTML form designed with meticulous validations. Fields like Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, Email, Contact Number, and Customer Address feature error messages to guide users towards accurate submissions.

2. **Dynamically Add Order Items (HTML & JavaScript):** A simple click dynamically adds order items using JavaScript. Category, Item Name, Price, and Quantity fields are added to the form, updating the Total Amount field in real-time based on price and quantity changes.

3. **Calculate Total Bill Amount (JavaScript):** JavaScript enables automatic calculation of the Total Bill Amount. As order items are added or modified, the Total Bill Amount is computed, reducing manual errors.

In essence, the Veggie Pizza app harmonizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. This synergy creates an intuitive and efficient pizza ordering experience. The app's user-friendly design, real-time calculations, and reliable data storage make it a valuable tool for both call operators and customers, facilitating seamless and accurate pizza orders.
